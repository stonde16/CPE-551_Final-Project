A  signature extractor from images and PDF files is a project that aims to extract a signature from an input image or PDF document. This can be useful for various purposes, such as legal or financial document verification.
The process of signature extraction from an image or PDF file can involve several steps, such as pre-processing the image, detecting the signature region, and extracting the signature itself.


In this project, OpenCV is the library used along with scikit-image on python.
Once the signature is extracted, it can be further processed, such as converting it to a vector format or comparing it to other signatures for verification purposes. The accuracy of signature extraction depends on the quality of the input image or PDF file.
